# go-practice

Just a running log of me practicing ~~Hackerrank with~~ Go

## Rationalle

Tried jumping straight into a ridesharing server that orchestrates activity with Cadence.

I could probably keep trucking along but I'd prefer some small wins along the way. I don't know enough about this language yet..

## Learning Journey

Starting with [Go.Dev docs](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started)

I wanna get basic syntax and cli usage kinda down. Then -

- Make a basic API that fetches spotify song data.
- Format it into a Song of the Day for my own purposeeeesss
- Play with tokens
- Tie in go-true
- Then I should be chilling.

## Music along this journey

Anything with Zack Fox.
His [Elevator Music set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVZkcDOal7w) has been on loop for a while now.

## Milestones

### Started working with Go again

I've been interested for about as long as this repo's existed. That was Sep 11, 2021. Glad we're cooking again. End goal is to make a ridesharing orchestrator to handle [Prestige](https://github.com/Guysnacho/prestige) traffic and to make the [TwoTone API](https://github.com/Guysnacho/twotoneweb) better, less wasteful, kinda cooler, more fun to work on.
